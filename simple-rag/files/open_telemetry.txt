#  Introduction
OpenTelemetry is a framework for collecting and delivering telemetry data for applications, services, and infrastructure. It provides vendor-neutral tools, APIs, and SDKs for ingesting, transforming, and sending data to an observability back-end, either open source or commercial.

Formed through the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus in 2019, OpenTelemetry addresses the challenges of debugging distributed, microservices-based architectures. Instrumentation and use of metrics, logging, and tracing software can become complicated in modern computing environments due to a lack of standards. OpenTelemetry solves these challenges by exporting data to open source or commercial observability back-ends through a standardized protocol. Its pluggable architecture allows other technology protocols and formats to be easily added.

OpenTelemetry entered the CNCF sandbox in 2019 and reached the incubation stage in August 2021.

This report assesses the state of the OpenTelemetry project and how CNCF has impacted its progress and growth. Alas we don’t have access to a multiverse to play out alternative scenarios, so it is impossible to sort out causation. However, we can document correlations. This report is part of a series of project journey reports published by CNCF.

NOTE: These statistics were collected with the DevStats tool, which CNCF built in collaboration with CNCF project communities. When we refer to “Contributor,” we mean somebody who made a review, commented, committed, created a PR or issue.
